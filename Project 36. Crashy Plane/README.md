## TO-DO:
- [ ] Add another type of obstacles.
- [ ] Implement game difficulty ramp up (either by decreasing the gap between the rocks or by increasing the world gravity).
- [ ] Implement a secondary scoring mechanism (e.g. by giving extra points if the player fly through hoops in between the rocks).
- [ ] Make it a universal game (i.e. support both iPad and iPhone).
